# atom easy-motion (redux) package

> MovementSpeed++. Jump to any word in your current view super fast.

**Note:** this package is a complete rewrite (Atom 1.0 API compliant) of the great (*but seems dead*) [easy-motion package](https://github.com/adrian-budau/easy-motion) from Adrian Budau.

Check out that repository to better understand what this plugin does.

To start easy-motion press **Shift+Cmd+E**. Rebind this in settings to better suit you. By default the characters that replace words are **ABC....Z**. You can replace this if you want, also from settings.

Extra commands:  
* **Shift+Cmd+Y** - same word search except it will match the ending of the word

Extra Features:  
* Pressing **Shift+Cmd+E** or **Shift+Cmd+Y** from within the find-and-replace panel will try using easy motion to match the words on the screen, it's faster than pressing enter many times.
