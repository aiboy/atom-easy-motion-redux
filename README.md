**Note:** this package is a partial rewrite (to match Atom 1.0 API compliant) of the great (*but seems dead*) [easy-motion package](https://github.com/adrian-budau/easy-motion) from Adrian Budau.

Check out that repository to better understand what this plugin does.

To start easy-motion press **Shift+Cmd+E**. Rebind this in settings to better suit you. By default the characters that replace words are **ABC....Z**. You can replace this if you want, also from settings.
